What problems does ERC777 Solve?
Backward Compatibility: ERC777 is fully backward compatible with ERC20, meaning that any software that can interact with ERC20 can also interact with ERC777.

Hooks for Tokens: ERC777 introduces hooks (tokensReceived and tokensToSend) that allow for more complex logic to be executed when tokens are transferred, received, or burned. This is useful for things like notifying a contract when it receives tokens.

Operator Support: ERC777 allows for "operators" that can control tokens on behalf of another address, providing a built-in mechanism for things like transaction fees or third-party account recovery.

Simplifies Logic via Atomic Transactions: Because of hooks, many functions that would require two separate transactions in ERC20 (e.g., approve and transferFrom) can be done atomically in one transaction, reducing complexity and potential errors. The hooks and operator features allow for more complex operations to be completed in a single transaction, reducing the need for multiple transactions and approvals, which can be error-prone.

No approve Double-Spend Issue: ERC777 eliminates the well-known issue in ERC20 where calling approve on an already approved address can potentially lead to a double-spend attack.


Issues with ERC777
Reentrancy Attacks: The hooks can potentially introduce reentrancy attacks if not implemented carefully. This was notably exploited in the 2020 attack on the Uniswap-Lendf.Me protocol.

Adoption: ERC777 is not as widely adopted as ERC20, meaning fewer wallets and exchanges support it.

Complexity: The additional features and hooks make ERC777 more complex to implement and understand, which could lead to bugs or vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.

Gas Costs: The additional features and complexity in ERC777 could potentially result in higher gas costs for certain operations compared to ERC20.

Security Audits: Given the added complexity and the potential for reentrancy attacks, smart contracts based on ERC777 may require more rigorous security audits.

Regulatory Compliance: The operator feature could be used to implement regulatory compliance directly into the token, although this could also be a double-edged sword depending on the jurisdiction.



Why was ERC1363 introduced?
Extended Spending Mechanism: ERC1363 is designed to be an "extended" ERC20 token that adds two methods to allow tokens to be spent by another on-chain contract as part of the approval process. This enables "transfer and call" or "approve and call" mechanisms in a single transaction.

Developer-Friendly and Improved Usability: It aims to make it easier for developers to create applications where tokens can be used directly to interact with smart contracts, without requiring a two-step process. By extending ERC20, it allows developers to integrate it more easily into existing systems without having to adopt an entirely new standard. It's more flexible than ERC777 in that it doesn't mandate new token standards but extends the ERC20 standard, making it easier to adopt. The standard aims to simplify the user experience by enabling more complex interactions to be completed in a single transaction.

Smart Contract Interactions: It facilitates direct interaction with smart contracts, enabling use-cases like on-chain subscriptions, automatic fee payments, and more. One of the key things to understand about ERC1363 is the specific use-cases it enables, such as on-chain marketplaces, crowdfunding, et cetera. Being aware of these specific use cases can help you to determine when to use ERC1363 over other standards.

Fallback Functions: ERC1363 allows for a receiver contract to implement a fallback function that gets executed when tokens are sent to it, similar to how Ether transactions work. This is a feature that could be crucial for certain dApps.

Layer 2 and Cross-Chain Compatibility: Given its extended functionality, ERC1363 could potentially be more compatible with Layer 2 solutions or cross-chain bridges, although this would depend on the specific implementation.



Issues with ERC1363
Adoption: Like ERC777, ERC1363 also suffers from a lack of widespread adoption compared to ERC20. ERC20 has the broadest support, but the features of ERC777 and ERC1363 may outweigh this depending on your project's needs.

Complexity: While it aims to simplify interactions, the additional methods can add complexity to smart contract development.

Potential for Confusion: Because it's an extension of ERC20, there might be confusion or compatibility issues when interacting with contracts that expect a plain ERC20 token. In other words, it could lead to compatibility issues with contracts expecting a plain ERC20 token, especially if those contracts are not updated to recognize ERC1363's additional methods.

Legal Implications: The ability to execute more complex transactions and interactions directly within the token contract could have legal implications, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the transaction.

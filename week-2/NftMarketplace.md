Solidity events are crucial in building efficient and user-friendly dApps. They provide a logging mechanism, allowing dApps to react to contract state changes, or external systems to get insights into contract operation. In the context of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) marketplaces like OpenSea, events are instrumental in tracking ownership and other pertinent activities surrounding NFTs.

The ERC-721 standard, which is widely used for creating NFTs, defines a set of events, including Transfer and Approval, that get emitted upon the occurrence of certain actions. However, not all ERC-721 contracts implement the ERC-721 Enumerable extension, which would allow for easy enumeration of tokens owned by a specific address.

In light of this, there are several ways OpenSea or a similar marketplace can quickly determine which NFTs an address owns, and how one might approach this challenge when building an NFT marketplace:

Listen for Transfer Events: Whenever a Transfer event is emitted, it indicates a change in ownership of a particular NFT. By continuously monitoring and indexing these events, a marketplace can maintain an up-to-date record of who owns what. ERC721 standard defines a Transfer event which is emitted every time the ownership of an NFT changes. The Ethereum blockchain stores the history of these events, which can be queried to determine the current owner of an NFT. However, this approach can be time-consuming and gas-intensive, especially if the marketplace needs to track ownership of a large number of NFTs. Moreover, this approach is not feasible for NFTs that don't implement the ERC721 standard or don't emit Transfer events. For instance, ERC1155 standard doesn't define a Transfer event, which means a marketplace would need to listen for other events to track ownership of ERC1155 tokens. In such cases, a marketplace would need to rely on other methods to track ownership of NFTs.

Off-chain Indexing: Off-chain indexing involves capturing and storing event data in an off-chain database. This can be done by running a server that listens for and indexes Transfer events from various NFT contracts. The indexed data can then be queried to quickly determine the NFTs owned by a particular address. However, this approach is also not feasible for NFTs that don't emit Transfer events, or for NFTs that don't implement the ERC721 standard. Moreover, this approach requires a centralized server, which might not be ideal for a decentralized marketplace.

MetaData Standard Compliance: Encouraging or ensuring that NFT contracts interfacing with your marketplace adhere to metadata standards will assist in the accurate and efficient retrieval of ownership information. OpenSea encourages NFT projects to comply with certain metadata standards. If a project complies with these standards, its NFTs can be easily listed and tracked on OpenSea. According to OpenSea's developer documentation, depending on the structure of your smart contract, custom integration may be possible if your contract is ERC721 or ERC1155 compliant, where you can provide a metadata URL for your items​​. This approach is not feasible for NFTs that don't implement the ERC721 standard or don't adhere to metadata standards. Moreover, this approach requires cooperation from NFT projects, which might not be feasible for all projects. Further, OpenSea may utilize the metadata associated with an NFT along with its unique ID for verification. 

Querying Multiple Contracts: If a list of popular or supported NFT contracts is maintained, a marketplace could potentially query each contract to check for ownership. However, this is likely to be very gas and time inefficient.

Utilizing Graph Protocol: The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. By defining a subgraph for NFT ownership, you can efficiently query ownership data across multiple contracts.

Cross-Contract Standards: Advocating for cross-contract standards such as EIP-2309 (which describes a standardized event emitted upon a successful contract call to a token contract's safeTransferFrom or mint method) can help standardize how ownership transfer events are handled across different contracts. Implementing cross-contract standards ensures tracking ownership can be standardized across different contracts, making it easier for marketplaces to track ownership.

Cooperation with Other Marketplaces: OpenSea compiles its marketplace data, which could include ownership information, and makes it available for sorting according to different criteria. This compiled data could be part of how OpenSea tracks NFT ownership​​. Sharing indexing efforts with other marketplaces or creating a shared infrastructure for indexing NFT ownership could also be a beneficial approach. 

Database: OpenSea could also possibly save all the addresses of the ERC721 contract an individual owns through Etherscan, querying and loading the NFT by listening on the contract to be informed when an NFT is created or transferred​​.

When creating an NFT marketplace, a combination of off-chain indexing, listening for transfer events, utilizing The Graph protocol, and encouraging metadata standard compliance would likely provide a robust solution for determining NFT ownership swiftly and accurately. However, it's important to note that not all NFTs implement the ERC721 standard, which means they might not emit Transfer events. Moreover, not all NFTs adhere to metadata standards, which means they might not be easily indexed. Therefore, it's important to consider these factors when determining how to track NFT ownership.

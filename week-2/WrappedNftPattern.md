The wrapped NFT (wNFT) pattern serves as an enhancement of standard NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) by introducing expanded functionalities. Here are some potential use cases and functionalities associated with the wrapped NFT pattern:

Economic Setup: The wrapped NFT pattern facilitates an economic setup by allowing for financial operations, which can be crucial in the realm of digital art, collectibles, and other domains where NFTs are applied.

On-chain Royalties: It can enable on-chain royalties, ensuring creators receive a portion of sales whenever their work is resold on secondary markets. This is particularly beneficial for artists, musicians, and creators, providing them with a sustainable income stream.

Rental Mechanism: Wrapped NFTs can introduce rental mechanisms, allowing owners to lend their NFTs temporarily to others, which could be applied in virtual real estate, digital asset leasing, or in-game item rentals.

Time/Value/Event-locks: The pattern allows for the implementation of time, value, or event-locked conditions, offering a more complex level of ownership or access control based on predetermined criteria.

Protection Against Devaluation: Wrapped NFTs can incorporate mechanisms to protect against devaluation, which is crucial in maintaining value, especially in volatile markets.

Anti-fraud Systems: By incorporating anti-fraud systems, the wrapped NFT pattern enhances the security and trustworthiness of NFT transactions, which is pivotal in markets where high-value assets are traded.

Asset Wrapping: One particularly interesting application is the ability to "wrap" other assets within an NFT. This can be envisioned as creating a "gift box" filled with various assets (tokens and other NFTs). This wrapping functionality can be utilized for bundle sales, gift packages, or complex asset ownership structures​1. By employing the wrapped NFT pattern, assets can be wrapped to interact with DeFi protocols. For instance, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is a representation of Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing Bitcoin holders to interact with Ethereum's DeFi ecosystem while retaining the underlying value of their assets.

Asset Tokenization and Interoperability: Wrapped NFTs could facilitate asset tokenization and enable interoperability between different blockchains. By wrapping assets as NFTs, they can be moved across different blockchain networks while maintaining their value and uniqueness​1.

Loyalty Programs: Brands might use wrapped NFTs to create loyalty programs where customers can earn, trade, or redeem NFT-based rewards. Although not explicitly utilizing wrapped NFTs, Starbucks is one example of a brand exploring NFT-based loyalty programs​3​.

Unique Auctions and Sales: The wrapped NFT pattern could be used for unique auctions and sales of digital or physical items, similar to the high-profile auction of Beeple's digital art collection​​.

Enhanced Security for Digital Assets: The wrapped NFT pattern could be employed to enhance security and verify authenticity for high-value digital assets, akin to how luxury brands are utilizing NFTs to combat counterfeiting​​.

Access Control: Wrapped NFTs could be used to manage access to exclusive communities, beta products, or special events, similar to how NFTs are being used for access control in various scenarios​​. 

Virtual Assets in Metaverse: In the Metaverse, the wrapped NFT pattern could enable advanced ownership and trade of virtual assets, facilitating unique virtual fashion shows and auctions, as seen in some recent explorations with NFTs in virtual environments​​.

Fundraising and Financial Operations: Wrapped NFTs could evolve the principles and rules of fundraising, making them more suited for financial operations in the digital realm​.

Cross-Platform Trading: Wrapped NFTs enable collectors to trade their NFTs across different platforms without the need for complex and time-consuming migration processes, thus enhancing user experience and accessibility​.

Liquidity Provision: Wrapped NFTs can be used as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, allowing NFT holders to unlock liquidity while still maintaining ownership of their NFTs​.

Enhanced Launchpad Offerings: Scaleswap introduced a multi-chain wNFT pre-IDO Launchpad where the original NFT is placed in a digital vault, or wrapper, that can hold additional assets like any ERC-20 token. Moreover, it allows for setting locking periods to the collateral ERC-20 token and the NFT, which can be used to incentivize liquidity providers and to prevent dumping of tokens​.

Yield Boosting via NFT Staking Contracts: NFT staking contracts can be employed to boost yields for users supporting particular ecosystems. Through incentivizing DeFi stakers to supply their liquidity in a wrapped NFT, a price floor for a defined period can be enforced, illustrating the financial innovation that wrapped NFTs can bring to the table​4.

Multi-Asset Bundling: Wrapped NFTs could be used to bundle multiple assets, both fungible and non-fungible, into a single token. This could simplify the management and transfer of a collection of assets, or enable new kinds of transactions and interactions.

Identity Verification: The wrapped NFT pattern could be employed for identity verification purposes. By wrapping verifiable credentials within an NFT, individuals could prove certain attributes or qualifications without revealing other personal information. This could be used for KYC/AML purposes, or for verifying credentials such as educational degrees, professional certifications, or other qualifications.

Gamification and Reward Systems: Wrapped NFTs could serve as elements in gamification strategies, where users can earn, collect, and trade tokens with varying levels of rarity and value. This could be used in online communities, educational platforms, or customer engagement campaigns.

Historical Archiving: The wrapped NFT pattern could be used for archiving historical items, artifacts, or documents. By wrapping digital representations or information about physical items, these NFTs could serve as a blockchain-based provenance and verification system. This could be used for historical artifacts, art collections, or other items of historical significance.

Real Estate Transactions: Wrapped NFTs could potentially facilitate real estate transactions by wrapping legal documents, ownership records, or other relevant information within a token, simplifying the buying, selling, or leasing processes.

Insurance and Risk Management: Wrapped NFTs could be utilized to manage insurance policies or other risk management contracts on the blockchain, potentially simplifying claims processing and other interactions. This could be used for insurance policies, warranties, or other types of contracts.
